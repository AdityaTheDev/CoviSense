# CoviSense

CoviSense is a mobile application that detects various viruses. It is powered by my covid-19
detection deep learning model. It recognizes coronavirus by looking at the image that you
upload. The image should be an Xray image. It predicts the result with a confidence score. The
deep learning modelâ€™s confidence about its prediction is called the confidence score. The app is powered by a deep learning model which is a Convolutional Neural Network. A
convolutional neural network (CNN) is a type of artificial neural network used in
image recognition and processing that is specifically designed to process pixel data.
If you are interested to learn more about Convolutional neural networks then you can
google it out. So, yeah I have built a CNN model and trained using three different
classes of images, covid-19 x rays, pneumonia x rays and normal x rays(without any
disease). After building my deep learning model I made a mobile application and a
Web app integrating it with my deep learning model. Ofcourse, training the model
and building an application is a cumbersome task. My deep learning model achieved
a precision of 74.5% and a recall of 67.7%. I have been working on this product for a
couple of months. I believe that apps are the future of medical diagnostics.
